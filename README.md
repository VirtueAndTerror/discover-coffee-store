This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Motivation

The main purpose of this app is to acquire new web dev skills by paracticing on Next.js.

## Description

This Web App allows the user to locate nearby coffee shops based in their actual location.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

[API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) can be accessed on [http://localhost:3000/api/hello](http://localhost:3000/api/hello). This endpoint can be edited in `pages/api/hello.js`.

The `pages/api` directory is mapped to `/api/*`. Files in this directory are treated as [API routes](https://nextjs.org/docs/api-routes/introduction) instead of React pages.

## Learn More

This app makes use of Unspash.com API as well as the Foursqure.com API.

It also was build using Static Site Generation and Incremental Static Regeneration techniques.

## Deployment

This app has been deployed by using Vercel Platform from the creators of Next.js
